**Welcome to JuniorHub!**
Our organization is working to simplify the level of entry into the development process.
We want to make the initial experience of team development available, give the practice of team interaction in the field of a real project, the opportunity to create and implement our own projects. Among other things, we are creating a tool for finding like-minded people and a convenient tool for planning and tracking the development process.
